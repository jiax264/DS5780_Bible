Hebrews6,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

Now we will do this, if God lets us.","Therefore, let us abandon the principles of the doctrine of Christ, and go on to perfection. We should not return to the foundation of repentance from dead works, or to the foundation of faith toward God, or to the foundation of baptisms, or to the laying on of hands, or to the resurrection of the dead, or to the eternal judgment. We should do this, if God permits."

1Corinthians15,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says in the Writings; And he was put in the place of the dead; and on the third day he came back from the dead, as it says in the Writings; And he was seen by Cephas; then by the twelve; Then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, but some are sleeping; Then he was seen by James; then by all the Apostles.","Brothers and sisters, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you also received, and in which you stand.

With your wisdom and with your understanding you have gotten riches, and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures. By your great wisdom and by your trade you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God; behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon you, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness. They shall bring you down to the pit, and you shall die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas."""
Proverbs23,"When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.","When you take your seat at the feast with a ruler, give thought with care to what is before you; And put a knife to your throat, if you have a strong desire for food. Have no desire for his delicate food, for it is the bread of deceit.","When you sit to eat with a ruler, be mindful of what you are eating. If you are a man given to appetite, do not be tempted by the allure of his food. For it is deceptive food."

But I have sent the brothers, so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true, and that, as I said, you may be ready: For fear that, if any from Macedonia come with me, and you are not ready, we (not to say, you) might be put to shame in this thing.","And now we give you news, brethren, about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia; How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble, and were in the greatest need, they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others. For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts, Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints: And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God."

Leviticus22,"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the Lord.

No man of the seed of Aaron who is a leper, or who has a flow from his body, may take of the holy food till he is clean.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 'Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they must separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they must not profane my holy name in those things which they worship.

Ecclesiastes12,"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.","Let your mind be turned to your Maker in the days of your strength, while the evil days come not, and the years are far away when you will say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not dark, and the clouds come not back after the rain; In the day when the keepers of the house are shaking for fear, and the strong men are bent down, and the women who were crushing the grain are at rest because their number is small, and those looking out of the windows are unable to see; When the doors are shut in the street, and the sound of the crushing is low, and the voice of the bird is soft, and the daughters of music will be made low; And he is in fear of that which is high, and danger is in the road, and the tree is white with flower, and the least thing is a weight, and desire is at an end, because man goes to his last resting-place, and those who are sorrowing are in the streets; Before ever the silver cord is cut, or the vessel of gold is broken, or the pot is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the water-hole; And the dust goes back to the earth as it was, and the spirit goes back to God who gave it. All things are to no purpose, says the Preacher, all is to no purpose.","Remember the Lord in the days of your youth, while the evil days are not coming, nor the years draw near, when you will say, I have no pleasure in them. While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men bow down, and the grinders stop working because they are few, and those who look out of the windows are darkened, And the doors are shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he will rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music will be brought low; Also when they are afraid of that which is high, and fears will be in the way, and the almond tree will flourish, and the grasshopper will be a burden, and desire will fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to the Lord who gave it."

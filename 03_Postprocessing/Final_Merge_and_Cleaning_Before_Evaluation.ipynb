For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.   \n",

By which you are saved, if you keep in mind what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain. For I first preached to you the message of Christ dying for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried and rose again the third day according to the scriptures. And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve, and that he was seen by five hundred brethren at once. Of whom the greater part remain to this day, but some have fallen asleep.   \n",

For they drank from the same Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Jesus. But with many of them, God was not pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.   \n",

Men will be lovers of their own desires, greedy, boastful, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, immoral, lacking in love for God, trucebreakers, false witnesses, immoral, cruel, and uncaring toward those who are good. They will have a form of godliness, but they will deny the power of that godliness. They will turn away from those who are good.   \n",

For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts, Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints: And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God.   \n",

For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.   \n",

But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.   \n",

       "96  Let your mind be turned to your Maker in the days of your strength, while the evil days come not, and the years are far away when you will say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not dark, and the clouds come not back after the rain; In the day when the keepers of the house are shaking for fear, and the strong men are bent down, and the women who were crushing the grain are at rest because their number is small, and those looking out of the windows are unable to see; When the doors are shut in the street, and the sound of the crushing is low, and the voice of the bird is soft, and the daughters of music will be made low; And he is in fear of that which is high, and danger is in the road, and the tree is white with flower, and the least thing is a weight, and desire is at an end, because man goes to his last resting-place, and those who are sorrowing are in the streets; Before ever the silver cord is cut, or the vessel of gold is broken, or the pot is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the water-hole; And the dust goes back to the earth as it was, and the spirit goes back to God who gave it. All things are to no purpose, says the Preacher, all is to no purpose.   \n",

And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.   \n",

By which you are saved, if you keep in mind what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain. For I first preached to you the message of Christ dying for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried and rose again the third day according to the scriptures. And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve, and that he was seen by five hundred brethren at once. Of whom the greater part remain to this day, but some have fallen asleep.   \n",

For they drank from the same Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Jesus. But with many of them, God was not pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.   \n",

Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.   \n",

For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts, Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints: And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God.   \n",

       "96  Let your mind be turned to your Maker in the days of your strength, while the evil days come not, and the years are far away when you will say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not dark, and the clouds come not back after the rain; In the day when the keepers of the house are shaking for fear, and the strong men are bent down, and the women who were crushing the grain are at rest because their number is small, and those looking out of the windows are unable to see; When the doors are shut in the street, and the sound of the crushing is low, and the voice of the bird is soft, and the daughters of music will be made low; And he is in fear of that which is high, and danger is in the road, and the tree is white with flower, and the least thing is a weight, and desire is at an end, because man goes to his last resting-place, and those who are sorrowing are in the streets; Before ever the silver cord is cut, or the vessel of gold is broken, or the pot is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the water-hole; And the dust goes back to the earth as it was, and the spirit goes back to God who gave it.

       "96  Keep in mind now your Creator in the days of your youth, when the evil days come not, or the years come near, when you will say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun or the light or the moon or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds come back after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house will be shaking, and the strong men will give themselves up to trembling; and the grain-crushing will come to an end because there are few, and those who are looking out of the windows will be dark, And the doors will be shut in the streets when the sound of the grain is low, and he will get up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music will be brought down; Also when they will be afraid of that which is high, and fears will be in the way, and almond will give fruit, and grasshopper will be a burden, and desire will be broken: because man goes to his long place and the mourners go about the streets: Or ever the silver cord will be loose, or broken in the golden bowl or the pitcher broken at the fountain or the wheel broken. Then the dust will come back to the earth as it was: and the spirit will go back to God who gave it.  "
